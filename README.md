# Shotzky's Backpack

Shotzky's Backpack is a Stabound furniture mod that aims to add things that are not common to be added by other mods. Originately, this mod was not supposed to be released to the public, but since I need a digital backup and some friends are asking for it, I've decided to publish on the Steam workshop.

I like pixeart but I am not good on it yet, don't expect too much from it. I will try to recreate the sprites whenever possible.

As said, the main idea is to add things that are not common to be added by other mod, so this means that most of these things may be useless but I create then to create a kind of immersion to my gameplay.

I tried to create the objects following the game's artistic style.

## About the objects/props

- Objects are identified by the ```sbp_[size(optional)]_[object]_[color(optional)]_[version(optional)]``` standard to avoid any problems and to simplify some development processes. Example: ```sbp_forklift_yellow```.
- An object can have more than one category, it will always occupy exact blocks (one block = 8 pixels) and the race field will always be generic.

## Suggestions and questions

You can use github issues to make a suggestion or to report any bug
